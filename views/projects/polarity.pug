    | I built Presidential Polarity to demonstrate the capabilities of 
    | #[+link('/projects/sentiment', 'Twitter Sentiment Platform')(title="Learn more about Twitter Sentiment Platform")]
    | tweets containing the word #[strong Trump] and write them to disc. Every 15
    | minutes, I run the tweets through an analysis pipeline and determine their
    | sentiment. This data is served by an API, and tweets are posted daily and
    | weekly. The visualization itself is written in #[+link('https://d3js.org/', 'D3.js')(title="D3", target="_blank")].
